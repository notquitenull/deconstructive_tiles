# Deconstructive Tiles
A mod for Factorio which adds a new "Deconstructive Tile".

# Functionality
- normal build: mark any entity ontop of it for deconstruction
- ghost build: mark all entitiey on it's position for deconstruction (tldr: the ghost deletes itself)

# Credit
This mod was written with heavy inspiration from Dectorio's source code, which was a great help for figuring out what I had to do without spending houers digging through documentation.

# Known Issues:
 - curved rail ghosts have a large "blind spot" in which the tile doesn't work
